			<h2>TR6e</h2>
			<h3>Making a Classic 2-Seater Electric</h3>
			<p>My goal is to make a battery powered TR6 with similar performance characteristics to its original ICE drivetrain.</p>
			<p>My current aim is to install a 10kWh battery pack with BMS and charging unit, a 130kW electric motor (PMSM preferably) and an apprpriate inverter and ECU.</p>
			<p>Initally the idea to do the conversion came about from going to the Formula E testing at Donnington in Septemebr 2016. The drivetrain for Formula E, 
			particularly the first season drive train made by MAT, would be ideal for an electric car conversion.</p>
